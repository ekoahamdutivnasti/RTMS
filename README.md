# Real-Time Monitoring System (RTMS)

This project is a Real-Time Monitoring System designed to monitor AI responses and handle security-related tasks.

## Features

- AI response generation
- Response validation
- Secure password generation
- Simulation mode for incorrect responses
- Logging and database support

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies.
3. Run the system using `python main.py`.

## Configuration

The system configuration is stored in `config/config.json`.

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs/rtms.log` file.

## Security

The `SecurePasswordGenerator` ensures that all passwords generated are unique and secure.

## Future Improvements

- Add more complex AI response handling.
- Expand simulation mode with interactive content.
- Implement more robust validation techniques.
